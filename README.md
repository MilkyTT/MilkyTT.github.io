# About My Project
Hello, my project is about data analysis and data visualization. This repository has my intro/motivation, blog posts, and my tips to high school students going to take this course next year! My other repository contains my project since my project required me to build my Github account before the class tutorial was out.

Please access my two microprojects: 
1. Trends in High School: (https://github.com/MilkyTT/FinalProjectProgramming/blob/main/microproject-01-trends-in-high-school-gpas/microproject-01-trends-in-high-school-gpas.ipynb)
2. FIFA Matches since 1872: (https://github.com/MilkyTT/FinalProjectProgramming/blob/main/microproject-08-fifa-matches-since-1872/microproject-08-fifa-matches-since-1872.ipynb)
