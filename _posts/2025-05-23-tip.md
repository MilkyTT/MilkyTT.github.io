## What’s One Thing You’d Tell Someone Starting This Course?

Looking back, what’s one piece of advice you’d give to someone just beginning this project or course? What helped you most—whether it was a mindset, habit, or practical strategy? 
What I would tell someone when starting this course, is to really make sure you start early, and work quickly, and overall be effective with your time. Starting homeworks the day they are assigned is definitely a great thing to do, and if you see you cannot submit them by the deadline, you can just submit them.

## What Did You Learn That Might Stick With You?

What did this project teach you—about programming, learning, or yourself? You can talk about a specific concept you finally understood, a skill you improved, or a moment you felt proud of your work or proud of yourself!
I learned how programming was really like learning another language. There is a saying that the first step for learning another language is confusion. I found the same way was true for learning a programming language, like Python. The next few steps are recognizing patterns, listening (or reading), and then speaking/typing/writing. This will stick with me when I find it useful to learn another programming language.

## What Helped You Get Through Challenges?

How did you handle bugs, confusion, or lack of motivation? What would you tell someone who hits a roadblock and isn’t sure how to keep going?
I handled the confusion by sitting through it by myself at first and if I did not understand, I would ask Lux (my programming teacher) for help. I would say ask for help when you need it. Also, something that made me just to keep going was just that I could not give up. If someone really works through negative psychology, this would work well.

## What’s Next for You?

What are you planning to focus on after this class—another project, a different course, an artistic or academic goal? Even if it’s not related to CS, how might the skills you practiced here (like logical thinking, problem-solving, or creative debugging) show up in the future?
I plan to explore more data analysis. Specifically, I would like to explore the ways I can graph data. So far I learned how to graph line graphs and bar graphs, but I would like to explore more ways.
