### What I Set Out to Do

I wanted to explore and analyze more data before I went to my next microproject. I wanted to work on visualization.

### What I Actually Did

I wanted to see the trends of high school students' GPAs from between 2004 and 2023. The schools that I analyzed were Winsconson, Michigan and Michigan State. I visualized this data by assigning the x and y axes to different columns of the table (i.e. year and percentage of students with GPAs, respectively), and the different lines representing the different schools.

### What I Learned or Noticed

When graphing data in Python, I had to install the module matplotlib. I learned this when I got an error when I got the code. The error message told me to install the matplotlib. I searched the current Python and wrote code to install matplotlib in the terminal of Visual Studio Code. I ran the code, and I was able to install it.
Before today, I was following the tutorial on how to set up the graph using Python, so I had a vague idea on how the code worked. Today, I created my own question about the data, and then manipulated the code.

### What's Next

I will work on a very interesting data set on FIFA matches since 1872. I will do the same expriments with the data and also explore the data on my own (with and without the tutorial).
