title: "Day 3 - Analyzing FIFA Data from 1872 to Present"
---

### What I Set Out to Do

I was aiming to work on on FIFA dataset since 1872. I will do the same experiments with the data and also explore the data on my own and with tutorials


### What I Actually Did

Today, I worked with data on FIFA soccer matches since 1872. The data included different attribute including the different teams (i.e. the home team vs. the away team), the home score, the away score etc. I was first introduced to data cleaning, and had to use the .dropna() method, which removes the empty parts of the table. I added a column called "year" column that showed the year each match took place. I accessed the specific column date and sliced the four characters that represented the year, and assigned it to a new column.


### What I Learned or Noticed

When graphing data in Python, I had to install the module matplotlib. I learned this when I got an error when I got the code. The error message told me to install the matplotlib. I searched the current Python and wrote code to install matplotlib in the terminal of Visual Studio Code. I ran the code, and I was able to install it.
I realized that I can access columns through indexing, just like I can access any other item in any other collection. I can also further index and slice the collection inside the item of the columns.


### What's Next

Next time, I will work on merging two dataframes into one dataframe and visualizing the data I collected. I also plan to experiment with data analysis and learn more if I have more time.
