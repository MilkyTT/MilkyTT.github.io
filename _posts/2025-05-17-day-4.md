title: "Day 4 - Merging Unmatched Data"
---

### What I Set Out to Do 

This week, I aimed to finish a module from discovery.cs.illinois.edu. I wanted to review core concepts before I moved forward on my second microproject. I was aiming to make a singular DataFrame of all the teams that either never played a home game or never played an away game since 1872. Because I already obtained a DataFrame of every single FIFA game since 1872, I had to accomplish my task through merging specific data from the large DataFrame. If I had extra time on my hands, I would have visualized the data and experiment with it.

### What I Actually Did 

I completed a module from discovery.cs.illinois.edu. I specifically focused on the Experimental Design section, the Types of Data section, and Python for Data Science section. These helped clarify some questions I had while completing the first microproject. I also merged two dataframes with unmatched dataframes together by using the pd.merge method. Because I had to merge value not found in boh datasets (i.e. unmatched values) I had to use this syntax pd.merge(how = "outer")).

  
### What I Learned or Noticed

From finishing the first module, I mostly just got a review because this is my fourth day working with data via Python. However I learned the difference between structured data and unstructured data. I learned that structured data is well-organized and categorized and unstructured data is not in a well-defined, organized, or categorized format. This information may seem intuitive, but learning these terms is important when learning data science. I also learned that in CSV files, a column is referred to as a variable and each row is called an observation. Finally, I combined two data frames into one by merging. I learned two ways to merge data frames: 1. merging dataframes with matching columns and 2. merging unmatched columns via Python. I had to merge unmatched columns via python and (pd.merge(how = "outer")) allowed me to do so.

### What's Next:

  Next I plan to visualize some of these dataframes that I have completed through merging and other methods of modifying data.
