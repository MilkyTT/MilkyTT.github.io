### What I Set Out to Do

I planned to analyze the certain data. For example, I planned to select the data of Freshman students from specific universities and display the data. Then, I planned to visualize the data and compare the students' GPA. I planned to create interesting questions based on the student data provided, analyze them, and create visuals to present the information.

### What I Actually Did

First, I assigned the variable df to the data from a URL. After exploring the data as I was previously, I wrote code that displayed certain parts of the large dataset that I was analyzing. For example, I selected data from all students who got 4.0 GPAs, from specific schools, and a combination of the two. These attributes were the columns of the data table. I wrote a code to list all of the different universities that appear in the dataset. I did this by finding the unique values for the column School.

Then, I also compared the percentages of Freshman college students getting above certain GPA overtime by visualizing the data. I displayed the data via line graph. The line graph had a legend with each line representing different schools. The year was the x-axis and the y-axis represented the percentages and the different lines represented the different types of schools.

### What I Learned or Noticed

When graphing data in Python, I had to install the module matplotlib. I learned this when I got an error when I got the code. The error message told me to install the matplotlib. I searched the current Python and wrote code to install matplotlib in the terminal of Visual Studio Code. I ran the code, and I was able to install it.

### What's Next

I want to explore and analyze more data before I go to my next microproject.
