### Project Focus
My project is working with given data and modifying them using Visual Studio Code, the Python app, Git, and GitHub. First, I had to download Visual Studio Code, the latest Python app, and create a GitHub account. Git already came with my computer, so I did not need to install that. I linked Python to Visual code and then linked Jupyter notebook to Visual Studio Code. I then tested the installed pandas, which is a data analysis module. I then dded the microproject to remotely to my repository. I then fetched the initial files by running the commands provided. My working title is Data Science MicroProjects. I started my first microproject on data science (i.e., Trends in High School GPAs). I am able to read the data and explored the High School GPAs dataset. I will do the analysis and the visualization the next day. I am interested because data science became a needed skill in the future and my future major, Bioengineering. The challenge was getting everything set up. Installing the required apps took me a lot of time, especially when I was getting errors because I did not finish installing the necessary apps and modules.

### Why This Project 

[What drew you to this idea? How does it connect to something you’re interested in—whether in or outside of class? Why is this the right project for *you* to work on right *now*?]
I wanted to make an algorithm that code detect cancer cells when given an image of cells sometime in the future, and I believe that this is a good beginning for data science and analysis. This is the right project for me right now because I am analyzing text based data which is doable in two weeks as oppose to using code that analyzes images and identifies them.

### What I Want to Learn

[What programming concepts do you want to strengthen through this project (e.g., functions, conditionals, loops, data structures)?  
Beyond coding, what personal or creative skills are you hoping to build—like debugging, problem solving, design, or perseverance?]
I want to learn the applications of what we learned in class already in data science, such as variables and data types, control structures, and data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and arrays. Furthermore, I would like to learn more about libraries and packages. For example, I learned about pandas which can be used for data manipulation and matplot for vizualization.


### My Approach 

[How do you plan to structure your time over the next two weeks? What will you focus on first? What will you prioritize later?  
What does “done enough” look like to you—and how will you decide when to stop polishing?]
I assigned two hours for each day to finish something related to my project. But it took me more than two hours just to set up the GitHub account and to install Python, Visual Studio Code, and the related libraries and packages for data analysis.

### What's Next

[What do you plan to tackle in the next stage of your project?]
I will analyze the data by, for example, selecting data of Freshman students from specific universities. Then, I will visualize the data and compare the student's GPA. I am planning to create interesting questions based on the student data provided, analyze them, and create visuals to present the information.
