## About Me

Hi, I'm Milky Tadesse, a student interested in data analysis.  
This project was part of my final quest in Computer Programming Fundamentals, and it reflects what I’ve learned about coding and its application.

## About My Project

**Project Title:** *Analyzing Data Using Python*   
**One-line pitch:** [“Two microprojects that analyze data: 1. Trends in High School GPAs  2. FIFA Matches since 1872”]
